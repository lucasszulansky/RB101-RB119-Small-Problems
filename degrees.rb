Problem:
Write a method that takes a floating point number that represents an angle between 0 and 360 degrees and returns a String that represents that angle in degrees, minutes and seconds. You should use a degree symbol (Â°) to represent degrees, a single quote (') to represent minutes, and a double quote (") to represent seconds. A degree has 60 minutes, while a minute has 60 seconds.

Constant for degree symbol - DEGREE = "\xC2\xB0"

Examples:

Data:

Algorithm:

Code:
=end

DEGREE = "\xC2\xB0"

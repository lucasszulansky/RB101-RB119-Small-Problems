Problem:
The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...) such that the first 2 numbers are 1 by definition, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers. This series appears throughout the natural world.

Computationally, the Fibonacci series is a very simple series, but the results grow at an incredibly rapid rate. For example, the 100th Fibonacci number is 354,224,848,179,261,915,075 -- that's enormous, especially considering that it takes 6 iterations before it generates the first 2 digit number.

Write a method that calculates and returns the index of the first Fibonacci number that has the number of digits specified as an argument. (The first Fibonacci number has index 1.)

You may assume that the argument is always greater than or equal to 2.

Input: Integer
Output: Integer

Examples:
find_fibonacci_index_by_length(2) == 7          # 1 1 2 3 5 8 13
find_fibonacci_index_by_length(3) == 12         # 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144
find_fibonacci_index_by_length(10) == 45
find_fibonacci_index_by_length(100) == 476
find_fibonacci_index_by_length(1000) == 4782
find_fibonacci_index_by_length(10000) == 47847

Data:
Input and output will be integers. We can store the Fibonacci series in an array.

Algorithm:
Given an integer, calculate numbers of the fibonacci series and add them to an array until the size of the most recently added number equals the argument integer. When this occurs, return the index of the final number + 1.

Code:

def find_fibonacci_index_by_length(number)
 fibonacci = [1, 1]
 
 loop do
  next_number = fibonacci[-1] + fibonacci[-2]
  fibonacci.push(next_number)
  break if fibonacci.last.digits.size == number
 end

 fibonacci.index(fibonacci[-1]) + 1
end
